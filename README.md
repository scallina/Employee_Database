# Employee_Database

## Overview of the Analysis
### In this analysis, I used SQL to assist an HR analyst performing research on retiring employeer populations. Specifically, I worked to answer the following questions: 
- Who will be retiring in the next few years? 
- How many positions will the company need to fill? 

## Results 
- the pool of eligible retirees consisted of 1550 people. 
- from the pool of retirees, the majority of employees held senior staff or engineer roles. 
- The mojortiy of program-eligilbe employees who started before 1995 occupied senior staff roles (see bar chart below). 
- The mojority of program-eligible employees who started after 1995 occupied engineer or saff roles (see bar chart below). 

## Summary 
- by the end of the "silver tsunami", 52,127 titles will be left vacant due to retirement. This will take place over several years. 
- using the bar chart shown below, we can infer that there will be enough senior staff and senior engineers to serve as mentors in the mentorship program for the next few years. However, as older employees begin to leave, senior staff pools will be the the most negatively impacted. I would recommend placing priority on senior staff members to serve as mentors in the program now to ensure generational knowledge is passed on.
